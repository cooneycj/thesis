@article{HoughtonSen2008a,
	Abstract = {The Victor-Purpura spike-train metric has recently been
extended to a family of multi-neuron metrics and used to analyze spike
trains recorded simultaneously from pairs of proximate neurons. The
Victor-Purpura metric is one of the two metrics commonly used for
quantifying the distance between two spike trains, the other is the
van Rossum metric. Here, we suggest an extension of the van Rossum
metric to a multi-neuron metric. We believe this gives a metric which
is both natural and easy to calculate. Both types of multi-neuron
metric are applied to simulated data and are compared.},

@article{AhissarEtAl2000a,
	Abstract = {The anatomical connections from the whiskers to the rodent
somatosensory (barrel) cortex form two parallel (lemniscal and
paralemniscal) pathways. It is unclear whether the paralemniscal
pathway is directly involved in tactile processing, because
paralemniscal neuronal responses show poor spatial resolution, labile
latencies and strong dependence on cortical feedback. Here we show
that the paralemniscal system can transform temporally encoded
vibrissal information into a rate code. We recorded the
representations of the frequency of whisker movement along the two
pathways in anaesthetized rats. In response to varying stimulus
frequencies, the lemniscal neurons exhibited amplitude modulations and
constant latencies. In contrast, paralemniscal neurons in both
thalamus and cortex coded the input frequency as changes in
latency. Because the onset latencies increased and the offset
latencies remained constant, the latency increments were translated
into a rate code: increasing onset latencies led to lower spike
counts. A thalamocortical loop that includes cortical oscillations and
thalamic gating can account for these results. Thus, variable
latencies and effective cortical feedback in the paralemniscal system
can serve the processing of temporal sensory cues, such as those that
encode object location during whisking. In contrast, fixed time
locking in the lemniscal system is crucial for reliable spatial
processing.},

@article{Albus1971a,
	Abstract = { A comprehensive theory of cerebellar function is presented,
                  which ties together the known anatomy and physiology
                  of the cerebellum into a pattern-recognition data
                  processing system. The cerebellum is postulated to
                  be functionally and structurally equivalent to a
                  modification of the classical Perceptron
                  pattern-classification device. It is suggested that
                  the mossy fiber --> granule cell --> Golgi cell
                  input network performs an expansion recoding that
                  enhances the pattern-discrimination capacity and
                  learning speed of the cerebellar Purkinje response
                  cells. Parallel fiber synapses of the dendritic
                  spines of Purkinje cells, basket cells, and stellate
                  cells are all postulated to be specifically variable
                  in response to climbing fiber activity. It is argued
                  that this variability is the mechanism of pattern
                  storage. It is demonstrated that, in order for the
                  learning process to be stable, pattern storage must
                  be accomplished principally by weakening synaptic
                  weights rather than by strengthening them.

	Abstract = {We estimated the spectrotemporal receptive fields of neurons
                  in the songbird auditory thalamus, nucleus
                  ovoidalis, and compared the neural representation of
                  complex sounds in the auditory thalamus to those
                  found in the upstream auditory midbrain nucleus,
                  mesencephalicus lateralis dorsalis (MLd), and the
                  downstream auditory pallial region, field L. Our
                  data refute the idea that the primary sensory
                  thalamus acts as a simple, relay nucleus: we find
                  that the auditory thalamic receptive fields obtained
                  in response to song are more complex than the ones
                  found in the midbrain. Moreover, we find that linear
                  tuning diversity and complexity in ovoidalis (Ov)
                  are closer to those found in field L than in MLd. We
                  also find prevalent tuning to intermediate spectral
                  and temporal modulations, a feature that is unique
                  to Ov. Thus even a feed-forward model of the sensory
                  processing chain, where neural responses in the
                  sensory thalamus reveals intermediate response
                  properties between those in the sensory periphery
                  and those in the primary sensory cortex, is
                  inadequate in describing the tuning found in
                  Ov. Based on these results, we believe that the
                  auditory thalamic circuitry plays an important role
                  in generating novel complex representations for
                  specific features found in natural sounds.},

	Abstract = {A spiking neuron {\sl computes} by transforming a complex
                  dynamical input into a train of action potentials,
                  or spikes. The computation performed by the neuron
                  can be formulated as dimensional reduction, or
                  feature detection, followed by a nonlinear decision
                  function over the low-dimensional
                  space. Generalizations of the reverse correlation
                  technique with white noise input provide a numerical
                  strategy for extracting the relevant low-dimensional
                  features from experimental data, and information
                  theory can be used to evaluate the quality of the
                  low-dimensional approximation. We apply these
                  methods to analyze the simplest biophysically
                  realistic model neuron, the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH)
                  model, using this system to illustrate the general
                  methodological issues. We focus on the features in
                  the stimulus that trigger a spike, explicitly
                  eliminating the effects of interactions between
                  spikes. One can approximate this triggering {\sl
                  feature space} as a two-dimensional linear subspace
                  in the high-dimensional space of input histories,
                  capturing in this way a substantial fraction of the
                  mutual information between inputs and spike time. We
                  find that an even better approximation, however, is
                  to describe the relevant subspace as two dimensional
                  but curved; in this way, we can capture 90\% of the
                  mutual information even at high time resolution. Our
                  analysis provides a new understanding of the
                  computational properties of the HH model. While it
                  is common to approximate neural behavior as {\sl
                  integrate and fire,} the HH model is not an
                  integrator nor is it well described by a single
                  threshold.},

	Abstract = {Quantifying the dissimilarity (or distance) between two
sequences is essential to the study of action potential (spike) trains
in neuroscience and genetic sequences in molecular biology. In
neuroscience, traditional methods for sequence comparisons rely on
techniques appropriate for multivariate data, which typically assume
that the space of sequences is intrinsically Euclidean. More recently,
metrics that do not make this assumption have been introduced for
comparison of neural activity patterns. These metrics have a formal
resemblance to those used in the comparison of genetic sequences. Yet
the relationship between such metrics and the traditional Euclidean
distances has remained unclear. We show, both analytically and
computationally, that the geometries associated with metric spaces of
event sequences are intrinsically non-Euclidean. Our results
demonstrate that metric spaces enrich the study of neural activity
patterns, since accounting for perceptual spaces requires a
non-Euclidean geometry.},

@article{AsariPearlmutterZador2006a,
	Abstract = {A striking feature of many sensory processing problems is that there appear to be many more neurons engaged in the internal representations of the signal than in its transduction. For example, humans have [~]30,000 cochlear neurons, but at least 1000 times as many neurons in the auditory cortex. Such apparently redundant internal representations have sometimes been proposed as necessary to overcome neuronal noise. We instead posit that they directly subserve computations of interest. Here we provide an example of how sparse overcomplete linear representations can directly solve difficult acoustic signal processing problems, using as an example monaural source separation using solely the cues provided by the differential filtering imposed on a source by its path from its origin to the cochlea [the head-related transfer function (HRTF)]. In contrast to much previous work, the HRTF is used here to separate auditory streams rather than to localize them in space. The experimentally testable predictions that arise from this model, including a novel method for estimating the optimal stimulus of a neuron using data from a multineuron recording experiment, are generic and apply to a wide range of sensory computations.

	Abstract = {The sensory pathways of animals are well adapted to processing a special class of signals, namely stimuli from the animal's environment. An important fact about natural stimuli is that they are typically very redundant and hence the sampled representation of these signals formed by the array of sensory cells is inefficient. One could argue for some animals and pathways, as the author does in this review, that efficiency of information representation in the nervous system has several evolutionary advantages. Consequently, one might expect that much of the processing in the early levels of these sensory pathways could be dedicated towards recording incoming signals into a more efficient form. The author explores the principle of efficiency of information representation as a design principle for sensory processing. He gives a preliminary discussion on how this principle could be applied in general to predict neural processing and then discuss concretely some neural systems where it recently has been shown to be successful. In particular, he examines the fly's LMC coding strategy and the mammalian retinal coding in the spatial, temporal and chromatic domains. },

	Abstract = {We describe here a new way of obtaining maps of connectivity in the human brain based on interregional correlations of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during natural viewing conditions. We propose that anatomical connections are reflected in BOLD signal correlations during natural brain dynamics. This may provide a powerful approach to chart connectivity, more so than that based on the `resting state' of the human brain, and it may complement diffusion tensor imaging. Our approach relies on natural brain dynamics and is therefore experimentally unbiased and independent of hypothesis-driven, specialized stimuli. It has the advantage that natural viewing leads to considerably stronger cortical activity than rest, thus facilitating detection of weaker connections. To validate our technique, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record BOLD signal while volunteers freely viewed a movie that was interrupted by resting periods. We used independent component analysis (ICA) to segregate cortical areas before characterizing the dynamics of their BOLD signal during free viewing and rest. Natural viewing and rest each revealed highly specific correlation maps, which reflected known anatomical connections. Examples are homologous regions in visual and auditory cortices in the two hemispheres and the language network consisting of Wernicke's area, Broca's area, and a premotor region. Correlations between regions known to be directly connected were always substantially higher than between nonconnected regions. Furthermore, compared to rest, natural viewing specifically increased correlations between anatomically connected regions while it decreased correlations between nonconnected regions. Our findings therefore demonstrate that natural viewing conditions lead to particularly specific interregional correlations and thus provide a powerful environment to reveal anatomical connectivity in vivo.},

	Abstract = {
Cerebellum-like structures in fish appear to act as adaptive sensory processors, in which learned predictions about sensory input are generated and subtracted from actual sensory input, allowing unpredicted inputs to stand out1‚{\"A}{\`\i}3. Pairing sensory input with centrally originating predictive signals, such as corollary discharge signals linked to motor commands, results in neural responses to the predictive signals alone that are Negative images' of the previously paired sensory responses. Adding these 'negative images' to actual sensory inputs minimizes the neural response to predictable sensory features. At the cellular level, sensory input is relayed to the basal region of Purkinje-like cells, whereas predictive signals are relayed by parallel fibres to the apical dendrites of the same cells4. The generation of negative images could be explained by plasticity at parallel fibre synapses5‚{\"A}{\`\i}7. We show here that such plasticity exists in the electrosensory lobe of mormyrid electric fish and that it has the necessary properties for such a model: it is reversible, anti-hebbian (excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are depressed after pairing with a postsynaptic spike) and tightly dependent on the sequence of pre- and postsynaptic events, with depression occurring only if the postsynaptic spike follows EPSP onset within 60 ms.

	Abstract = {Traditional approaches to neural coding characterize the
encoding of known stimuli in average neural responses. Organisms face
nearly the opposite task--extracting information about an unknown
time-dependent stimulus from short segments of a spike train. Here the
neural code was characterized from the point of view of the organism,
culminating in algorithms for real-time stimulus estimation based on a
single example of the spike train. These methods were applied to an
identified movement-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system. Such
decoding experiments determined the effective noise level and fault
tolerance of neural computation, and the structure of the decoding
algorithms suggested a simple model for real-time analog signal
processing with spiking neurons.},

sequences of discrete, identical action potentials or spikes;
information is carried only in the spike arrival times. We show how to

Social distance attachment is represented by the tendency of peers to establish acquaintances via a decreasing function of the relative distance in a representative social space. We derive analytical results (corroborated by extensive numerical simulations), showing that the model reproduces the main statistical characteristics of real social networks: large clustering coefficient, positive degree correlations, and the emergence of a hierarchy of communities. The model is confronted with the social network formed by people that shares confidential information using the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption algorithm, the so-called web of trust of PGP. },

	Abstract = {Information theory quantifies how much information a neural
response carries about the stimulus. This can be compared to the
information transferred in particular models of the stimulus-response
function and to maximum possible information transfer. Such
comparisons are crucial because they validate assumptions present in
any neurophysiological analysis. Here we review information-theory
basics before demonstrating its use in neural coding. We show how to
use information theory to validate simple stimulus-response models of
neural coding of dynamic stimuli. Because these models require
specification of spike timing precision, they can reveal which time
scales contain information in neural coding. This approach shows that
dynamic stimuli can be encoded efficiently by single neurons and that
each spike contributes to information transmission. We argue, however,
that the data obtained so far do not suggest a temporal code, in which
the placement of spikes relative to each other yields additional
information.},

	Abstract = { Suppose we wish to recover an n-dimensional real-valued vector x_0 (e.g. a digital signal or image) from incomplete and contaminated observations y = A x_0 + e; A is a n by m matrix with far fewer rows than columns (n << m) and e is an error term. Is it possible to recover x_0 accurately based on the data y?
    To recover x_0, we consider the solution x* to the l1-regularization problem min \|x\|_1 subject to \|Ax-y\|_2 <= epsilon, where epsilon is the size of the error term e. We show that if A obeys a uniform uncertainty principle (with unit-normed columns) and if the vector x_0 is sufficiently sparse, then the solution is within the noise level \|x* - x_0\|_2 \le C epsilon.
    As a first example, suppose that A is a Gaussian random matrix, then stable recovery occurs for almost all such A's provided that the number of nonzeros of x_0 is of about the same order as the number of observations. Second, suppose one observes few Fourier samples of x_0, then stable recovery occurs for almost any set of p coefficients provided that the number of nonzeros is of the order of n/[\log m]^6. In the case where the error term vanishes, the recovery is of course exact, and this work actually provides novel insights on the exact recovery phenomenon discussed in earlier papers. The methodology also explains why one can also very nearly recover approximately sparse signals.},

	Abstract = { The problem of blindly separating signal mixtures with
                  fewer mixture components than independent signal
                  sources is mathematically ill-defined, and requires
                  suitable prior information on the nature of the
                  sources. Recently, it has been shown that sparse
                  methods for function approximation using a Laplacian
                  prior can be effective, but the method fails to
                  separate a single mixture without further prior
                  information. Other techniques track harmonics, but
                  assume separability in the time-frequency domain. We
                  show that a measure of temporal and spectral
                  coherence provides an effective cue for separating
                  independent acoustical or sonar sources, in the
                  absence of spatial cues in the monaural case. The
                  technique is shown to successfully separate single
                  mixtures of sources with significant spectral
                  overlap },

signals can be reconstructed exactly from remarkably few mea-

eratively reweighted algorithms for computing local minima
of the nonconvex problem. In particular, a particular regu-
larization strategy is found to greatly improve the ability of a
reweighted least-squares algorithm to recover sparse signals,
with exact recovery being observed for signals that are much
less sparse than required by an unregularized version (such
as FOCUSS, [2]). Improvements are also observed for the
reweighted- 1 approach of [3].},

A theoretical justification of the technique is presented that relies only on elementary linear algebra and statistics. Implementation is described with examples. The technique and the underlying model of neural responses are validated using recordings from retinal ganglion cells, and in principle are applicable to other neurons. Advantages and disadvantages of the technique relative to classical approaches are discussed.},

Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(m d log n) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m ~ n and d ~ log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(n log2 n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web-site of a large online retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400,000 vertices and 2 million edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

	Abstract = {Several algorithms have been proposed to characterize the spectro-temporal tuning properties of auditory neurons during the presentation of natural stimuli. Algorithms designed to work at realistic signal-to-noise levels must make some prior assumptions about tuning in order to produce accurate fits, and these priors can introduce bias into estimates of tuning. We compare a new, computationally efficient algorithm for estimating tuning properties, boosting, to a more commonly used algorithm, normalized reverse correlation. These algorithms employ the same functional model and cost function, differing only in their priors. We use both algorithms to estimate spectro-temporal tuning properties of neurons in primary auditory cortex during the presentation of continuous human speech. Models estimated using either algorithm, have similar predictive power, although fits by boosting are slightly more accurate. More strikingly, neurons characterized with boosting appear tuned to narrower spectral bandwidths and higher temporal modulation rates than when characterized with normalized reverse correlation. These differences have little impact on responses to speech, which is spectrally broadband and modulated at low rates. However, we find that models estimated by boosting also predict responses to non-speech stimuli more accurately. These findings highlight the crucial role of priors in characterizing neuronal response properties with natural stimuli.},

	Abstract = {
Activation of the climbing fiber input powerfully excites cerebellar Purkinje cells via hundreds of widespread dendritic synapses, triggering dendritic spikes as well as a characteristic high-frequency burst of somatic spikes known as the complex spike. To investigate the relationship between dendritic spikes and the spikelets within the somatic complex spike, and to evaluate the importance of the dendritic distribution of climbing fiber synapses, we made simultaneous somatic and dendritic patch-clamp recordings from Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. Injection of large climbing fiber-like synaptic conductances at the soma using dynamic clamp was sufficient to reproduce the complex spike, independently of dendritic spikes, indicating that neither a dendritic synaptic distribution nor dendritic spikes are required. Furthermore, we found that dendritic spikes are not directly linked to spikelets in the complex spike, and that each dendritic spike is associated with only 0.24 ¬$\pm$ 0.09 extra somatic spikelets. Rather, we demonstrate that dendritic spikes regulate the pause in firing that follows the complex spike. Finally, using dual somatic and axonal recording, we show that all spikelets in the complex spike are axonally generated. Thus, complex spike generation proceeds relatively independently of dendritic spikes, reflecting the dual functional role of climbing fiber input: triggering plasticity at dendritic synapses and generating a distinct output signal in the axon. The encoding of dendritic spiking by the post-complex spike pause provides a novel computational function for dendritic spikes, which could serve to link these two roles at the level of the target neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei.

auditory skin that all animals must develop for basic survival. Birds
are one group of animals that use auditory communication for
everything from mating to prey capture. In general, how well humans

function of the properties of the signal and the properties of the
noise, and include spatial, temporal, and spectral
characteristics. Here, the abilities of birds to correctly identify
zebra finch songs embedded in different types of maskers that were
emitted from the same location or from separate locations (and
presented at different signal to noise ratios) were measured using
operant conditioning techniques. In general, zebra finches and
budgerigars showed very small differences in thresholds between songs
embedded in the three types of maskers: broadband noise, modulated
noise, and choruses of zebra finch songs. When the calls were emitted
from one location and the maskers from another, a condition that
elicits spatial unmasking in humans (Best et al., 2005), zebra finches
had lower thresholds while budgerigars generally did not. These
results suggest some species-specific advantages to listening in noisy
environments.},

Here we show the effects of night-sleep on song development in the zebra finch by recording and analysing the entire song ontogeny. During periods of rapid learning we observed a pronounced deterioration in song structure after night-sleep. The song regained structure after intense morning singing. Daily improvement in similarity to the tutored song occurred during the late phase of this morning recovery; little further improvement occurred thereafter. Furthermore, birds that showed stronger post-sleep deterioration during development achieved a better final imitation. The effect diminished with age. Our experiments showed that these oscillations were not a result of sleep inertia or lack of practice, indicating the possible involvement of an active process, perhaps neural song-replay during sleep. We suggest that these oscillations correspond to competing demands of plasticity and consolidation during learning, creating repeated opportunities to reshape previously learned motor skills.},

time-dependent input signals yield patterns of spikes that are much
more reproducible, both in terms of timing and of counting
precision. Variability and reproducibility are quantified with ideas
from information theory, and measured spike sequences in H1 carry more
than twice the amount of information they would if they followed the
variance-mean relation seen with constant inputs. Thus, models that

significantly underestimate the reliability of signal transfer under

@article{EcclesLlinasSasaki1966a,
	Abstract = {

1. A single climbing fibre makes an extraordinarily extensive synaptic contact with the dendrites of a Purkinje cell. Investigation of this synaptic mechanism in the cerebellum of the cat has been based on the discovery by Szentagothai & Rajkovits (1959) that the climbing fibres have their cells of origin in the contralateral inferior olive.

2. Stimulation in the accessory olive selectively excites fibres that have a powerful synaptic excitatory action on Purkinje cells in the contralateral vermis, evoking a repetitive spike discharge of 5-7 msec duration. Almost invariably this response had an all-or-nothing character. In every respect it corresponds with the synaptic action that is to be expected from climbing fibres.

3. Intracellular recording from Purkinje cells reveals that this climbing fibre stimulation evokes a large unitary depolarization with an initial spike and later partial spike responses superimposed on a sustained depolarization.

4. Typical climbing fibre responses can be excited, but in a much less selective manner, by stimulation of the olive-cerebellar pathway in the region of the fastigial nucleus, there being often a preceding antidromic spike potential of the Purkinje cell under observation.

5. Impaled Purkinje cells rapidly deteriorate with loss of all spike discharge, the climbing fibre response being then reduced to an excitatory post-synaptic potential. This potential shows that stimulation of the inferior olive may evoke two or more discharges at about 2 msec intervals in the same climbing fibre. The complexity of neuronal connexions in the inferior olive is also indicated by the considerable latency range in responses.

6. A further complication is that, with stimulation in the region of the fastigial nucleus, the initial direct climbing fibre response is often followed by a reflex discharge, presumably from the inferior olive, which resembles the responses produced by inferior olive stimulation in being often repetitive.

7. Typical climbing fibre responses have been evoked by peripheral nerve stimulation and frequently occur spontaneously.

8. An account is given of the way in which the responses evoked by climbing fibres in the individual Purkinje cells can account for the potential fields that an inferior olive stimulus evokes on the surface and through the depth of the cerebellar cortex.

9. By the application of currents through the recording intracellular electrode it has been possible to effect large changes in the excitatory post-synaptic potential produced by a climbing fibre, it being diminished and even reversed with depolarizing currents and greatly increased by hyperpolarizing currents.

	Abstract = {
Spike timing‚{\"A}{\`\i}dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) has emerged as the preferred framework linking patterns of pre- and postsynaptic activity to changes in synaptic strength. Although synaptic plasticity is widely believed to be a major component of learning, it is unclear how STDP itself could serve as a mechanism for general purpose learning. On the other hand, algorithms for reinforcement learning work on a wide variety of problems, but lack an experimentally established neural implementation. Here, we combine these paradigms in a novel model in which a modified version of STDP achieves reinforcement learning. We build this model in stages, identifying a minimal set of conditions needed to make it work. Using a performance-modulated modification of STDP in a two-layer feedforward network, we can train output neurons to generate arbitrarily selected spike trains or population responses. Furthermore, a given network can learn distinct responses to several different input patterns. We also describe in detail how this model might be implemented biologically. Thus our model offers a novel and biologically plausible implementation of reinforcement learning that is capable of training a neural population to produce a very wide range of possible mappings between synaptic input and spiking output.

seconds in vivo. We conclude that the prestimulus history of a neuron
may influence the precise timing of the spikes in response to a
stimulus over a wide range of time scales.  },

	Abstract = {In this paper we consider the Nonnegative Matrix
                  Factorization (NMF) problem: given an (elementwise)
                  nonnegative matrix $V \in \R_+^{m\times n}$ find,
                  for assigned $k$, nonnegative matrices
                  $W\in\R_+^{m\times k}$ and $H\in\R_+^{k\times n}$
                  such that $V=WH$. Exact, non trivial, nonnegative
                  factorizations do not always exist, hence it is
                  interesting to pose the approximate NMF problem. The
                  criterion which is commonly employed is I-divergence
                  between nonnegative matrices. The problem becomes
                  that of finding, for assigned $k$, the factorization
                  $WH$ closest to $V$ in I-divergence. An iterative
                  algorithm, EM like, for the construction of the best
                  pair $(W, H)$ has been proposed in the
                  literature. In this paper we interpret the algorithm
                  as an alternating minimization procedure \`a la
                  Csisz\'ar-Tusn\'ady and investigate some of its
                  stability properties. NMF is widespreading as a data
                  analysis method in applications for which the
                  positivity constraint is relevant. There are other
                  data analysis methods which impose some form of
                  nonnegativity: we discuss here the connections
                  between NMF and Archetypal Analysis. An interesting
                  system theoretic application of NMF is to the
                  problem of approximate realization of Hidden Markov
                  Models.},

	Abstract = {Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.},

                  sound stimulus in a time-frequency representation
                  and the neural response. Time-frequency
                  representations of a sound in turn require a
                  nonlinear operation on the sound pressure waveform
                  and many different forms for this non-linear
                  transformation are possible. Here, we systematically
                  investigated the effects of four factors in the
                  non-linear step in the STRF model: the choice of
                  logarithmic or linear filter frequency spacing, the
                  time-frequency scale, stimulus amplitude compression

                  modelling neurons. The time-frequency scale and
                  frequency spacing also affected the goodness of fit
                  of the model but to a lesser extent and the optimal

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties which seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this paper, we highlight another property which is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly-knit groups between which there are only looser connections. We propose a new method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known, and find that it detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well-known - a collaboration network and a food web - and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases. },

It is believed that societies with more social capital are more democratic and economically developed than societies with little social capital. However, social capital is a concept hard to quantify and measure in a ``real-word'' context. Here, we take advantage of an existing "web of trust'' between users of the "Pretty-Good-Privacy" (PGP) encryption algorithm, which is used in digital communication to ``sign'' documents so that the recipient knows for sure who the author is. Our analysis reveals the coexistence in the web of trust of a macro scale-free structure with micro strongly-connected cells in a complex network. We also show that when this network is intentionally attacked the scale-free structure rapidly disintegrates and that the resulting network is partitioned into a large number of small strongly-connected cells that are resilient to the intentional attack.},

In our scheme, the quadratic is minimized over a subspace which is adjusted in successive iterations to ensure convergence to an optimum.

	Abstract = {In recent years, it has become clear that motor learning, as revealed by associative eyelid conditioning and adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, contributes to the well-established cerebellar functions of sensorimotor integration and control. Long-term depression of the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse (which is often called 'cerebellar LTD') is a cellular phenomenon that has been suggested to underlie these forms of learning. However, it is clear that parallel fiber LTD, by itself, cannot account for all the properties of cerebellar motor learning. Here we review recent electrophysiological experiments that have described a rich variety of use-dependent plasticity in cerebellum, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and LTD of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and persistent modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability. Finally, using associative eyelid conditioning as an example, we propose some ideas about how these cellular phenomena might function and interact to endow the cerebellar circuit with particular computational and mnemonic properties.},

Extracellular spikes were recorded simultaneously from dendrites and somata of Purkinje cells in thin cerebellar sections. Spontaneously occurring dendritic spikes were biphasic with the initial phase positive. Triphasic dendritic spikes with a large negative phase appeared during electrophoretic application of glutamate. In media containing procaine, tetrodotoxin, or high concentrations of KCl, negative dendritic spikes occurred whereas soma spikes were abolished. The negative dendritic spikes were suppressed by CoCl2 or MnCl2. Electrical stimulation elicited climbing fibre responses in somata and large negative waves in dendrites. Spikes of dendritic origin were different from those reflecting electrotonic spread of soma spikes. The relation between soma spikes and active dendritic spikes is discussed.

	Abstract = {The spike timing reliability of Aplysia motoneurons stimulated by repeated presentation of periodic or aperiodic input currents is investigated. Two properties of the input are varied, the frequency content and the relative amplitude of the fluctuations to the mean (expressed as the coefficient of variation; CV). It is shown that, for small relative amplitude fluctuations (CV approx  0.05-0.15), the reliability of spike timing is enhanced if the input contains a resonant frequency equal to the firing rate of the neuron in response to the DC component of the input. This resonance-related enhancement in reliability decreases as the relative amplitude of the fluctuations increases (CV right-arrow 1). Similar results were obtained for a leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal model, suggesting that these effects are a general property of encoders that combine a threshold with a leaky integrator. These observations suggest that, when the magnitude of input fluctuations is small, changes in the power spectrum of the current fluctuations or in the spike discharge rate can have a pronounced effect on the ability of the neuron to encode a time-varying input with reliably timed spikes.},

	Abstract = {
Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a computationally powerful form of plasticity in which synapses are strengthened or weakened according to the temporal order and precise millisecond-scale delay between presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking activity. STDP is readily observed in vitro, but evidence for STDP in vivo is scarce. Here, we studied spike timing-dependent synaptic depression in single putative pyramidal neurons of the rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in vivo, using two techniques. First, we recorded extracellularly from layer 2/3 (L2/3) and L5 neurons, and paired spontaneous action potentials (postsynaptic spikes) with subsequent subthreshold deflection of one whisker (to drive presynaptic afferents to the recorded neuron) to produce ‚{\"A}{\'u}post-leading-pre‚{\"A}{\`u} spike pairings at known delays. Short delay pairings (<17 ms) resulted in a significant decrease of the extracellular spiking response specific to the paired whisker, consistent with spike timing-dependent synaptic depression. Second, in whole-cell recordings from neurons in L2/3, we paired postsynaptic spikes elicited by direct-current injection with subthreshold whisker deflection to drive presynaptic afferents to the recorded neuron at precise temporal delays. Post-leading-pre pairing (<33 ms delay) decreased the slope and amplitude of the PSP evoked by the paired whisker, whereas ‚{\"A}{\'u}pre-leading-post‚{\"A}{\`u} delays failed to produce depression, and sometimes produced potentiation of whisker-evoked PSPs. These results demonstrate that spike timing-dependent synaptic depression occurs in S1 in vivo, and is therefore a plausible plasticity mechanism in the sensory cortex.},

	Abstract = {Hierarchical methods are well-known clustering techniques that can be potentially very useful for various data mining tasks. A hierarchical clustering scheme produces a sequence of clusterings in which each clustering is nested into the next clustering in the sequence. Since hierarchical clustering is a greedy search algorithm based on a local search, the merging decisions made early in the agglomerative process are not necessarily the right ones. One possible solution to this problem is to refine a clustering produced by the agglomerative hierarchical algorithm to potentially correct the mistakes made early in the agglomerative process. The problem of refining a clustering has many similarities with that of refining a min-cut k-way partitioning of a graph. In this paper, the author explore multilevel refinement schemes for refining and improving the clusterings produced by hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This algorithm combines traditional hierarchical clustering with multilevel refinement that has been found to be very effective for computing min-cut k-way partitioning of graphs. They consider several clustering objective functions for the proposed refinement step and investigate the usefulness of these objective functions. Their experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm produces clustering solutions that are consistently and significantly better than those produced by hierarchical clustering algorithms alone. Furthermore, their algorithm has the additional advantage of being extremely fast, as it operates on a sparse similarity matrix. The amount of time required by the algorithm ranged from 2 seconds for a data set with 358 items, to 80 seconds for a data set with 9,133 items on a Pentium II },

Despite the low frequency of firing, complex spikes have been proposed to contribute to the initiation of arm movements, or to the gradual improvement of motor skills,,. Here we recorded the activity of Purkinje cells fromthe hemisphere of cerebellar lobules IV-VI while trained monkeys made short-lasting reaching movements (of ~200 milliseconds in duration) to touch a visual target that appeared at a random location on a tangent screen. We examined the relationship between complex-spike discharges and the absolute touch position, and between complex-spike discharges and relative errors in touching the screen. We used information theory to show that the complex spikes occurring at the beginning of the reach movement encode the absolute destination of the reach, and the complex spikes occurring at the end of the short-lasting movements encode the relative errors. Thus, complex spikes convey multiple types of information, consistent with the idea that they contribute both to the generation of movements and to the gradual, long-term improvement of these movements.},

	Abstract = {Information is transmitted in the brain through various kinds of neurons that respond differently to the same signal. Full characteristics including cognitive functions of the brain should ultimately be comprehended by building simulators capable of precisely mirroring spike responses of a variety of neurons. Neuronal modeling that had remained on a qualitative level has recently advanced to a quantitative level, but is still incapable of accurately predicting biological data and requires high computational cost. In this study, we devised a simple, fast computational model that can be tailored to any cortical neuron not only for reproducing but also for predicting a variety of spike responses to greatly fluctuating currents. The key features of this model are a multi-time scale adaptive threshold predictor and a nonresetting leaky integrator. This model is capable of reproducing a rich variety of neuronal spike responses, including regular spiking, intrinsic bursting, fast spiking, and chattering, by adjusting only three adaptive threshold parameters. This model can express a continuous variety of the firing characteristics in a three-dimensional parameter space rather than just those identified in the conventional discrete categorization. Both high flexibility and low computational cost would help to model the real brain function faithfully and examine how network properties may be influenced by the distributed characteristics of component neurons.

There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

	Abstract = {Many neural areas, notably, the hippocampus, show structured, dynamical, pop-
ulation behavior such as coordinated oscillations. It has long been observed that
such oscillations provide a substrate for representing analog information in the
firing phases of neurons relative to the underlying population rhythm. However,
it has become increasingly clear that it is essential for neural populations to rep-
resent uncertainty about the information they capture, and the substantial recent
work on neural codes for uncertainty has omitted any analysis of oscillatory sys-
tems. Here, we observe that, since neurons in an oscillatory network need not only
fire once in each cycle (or even at all), uncertainty about the analog quantities each
neuron represents by its firing phase might naturally be reported through the de-
gree of concentration of the spikes that it fires. We apply this theory to memory
in a model of oscillatory associative recall in hippocampal area CA3. Although
it is not well treated in the literature, representing and manipulating uncertainty
is fundamental to competent memory; our theory enables us to view CA3 as an
effective uncertainty-aware, retrieval system.},

By rotating the fly on a stepper motor outside in a wooded area, and along an angular motion trajectory representative of natural flight, we stimulate the fly's visual system with input that approaches the natural situation. The neural response is analysed in the framework of information theory, using methods that are free from assumptions. We demonstrate that information about the motion trajectory increases as the light level increases over a natural range. This indicates that the fly's brain utilizes the increase in photon flux to extract more information from the photoreceptor array, suggesting that imprecision in neural signals is dominated by photon shot noise in the physical input, rather than by noise generated within the nervous system itself.},

	Abstract = {The nonhomogeneous Poisson process is a widely used model for a series of events (stochastic point process) in which the -Y¥rate$\,^{\circ}$ or ¥intensity$\,^{\circ}$ of occurrence of points varies, usually with time. The process has the characteristic properties that the number of points in any finite set of nonoverlapping intervals are mutually independent random variables, and that the number of points in any of these intervals has a Poisson distribution. In this paper we first discuss several general methods for simulation of the one-dimensional non-homogeneous Poisson process; these include time-scale transformation of a homogeneous (rate one) Poisson process via the inverse of the integrated rate function, generation of the individual intervals between points, and generation of a Poisson number of order statistics from a fixed density function. We then state a particular and very efficient method for simulation of nonhomogeneous Poisson processes with log-linear rate function. The method is based on an identity relating the nonhomogeneous Poisson process to the gap statistics from a random number of exponential random variables with suitably chosen parameters. This method can also be used, at the cost of programming complexity and some memory, as the basis for a very efficient technique for simulation of nonhomogeneous Poisson processes with more complicated rate functions such as a log-quadratic rate function. Finally, we describe a simple and relatively efficient new method for simulation of one-dimensional and two-dimensional non-homogeneous Poisson processes. The method is applicable for any given rate function and is based on controlled deletion of points in a Poisson process with a rate function that dominates the given rate function. In its simplest implementation, the method obviates the need for numerical integration of the rate function, for ordering of points, and for generation of Poisson variates. The thinning method is also applicable to the generation of individual intervals between points, as is required in many programs for discrete-event simulations.},

	Abstract = { Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is useful to find basis information of nonnegative data. Currently, multiplicative updates are a simple and popular way to find the factorization. However, for the common NMF approach of minimizing the Euclidean distance between approximate and true values, no proof has shown that multiplicative updates converge to a stationary point of the NMF optimization problem. Stationarity is important as it is a necessary condition of a local minimum. This paper discusses the difficulty of proving the convergence. We propose slight modifications of existing updates and prove their convergence. Techniques invented in this paper may be applied to prove the convergence for other bound-constrained optimization problems.},

This raises the question of whether they can also solve a far more complicated task that might provide a basis for mate preference and sexual selection: to distinguish individual songs by detecting slight variations around the common species-specific theme. Using spike-train discriminability to quantify the precision of neural responses from the auditory periphery of a model grasshopper species, we show that information sufficient to distinguish songs is readily available at the single-cell level when the spike trains are analyzed on a millisecond time scale.

	Abstract = {How do cortical neurons represent the acoustic environment? This question is often addressed by probing with simple stimuli such as clicks or tone pips. Such stimuli have the advantage of yielding easily interpreted answers, but have the disadvantage that they may fail to uncover complex or higher-order neuronal response properties. Here, we adopt an alternative approach, probing neuronal responses with complex acoustic stimuli, including animal vocalizations. We used in vivo whole-cell methods in the rat auditory cortex to record subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations elicited by these stimuli. Most neurons responded robustly and reliably to the complex stimuli in our ensemble. Using regularization techniques, we estimated the linear component, the spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF), of the transformation from the sound (as represented by its time-varying spectrogram) to the membrane potential of the neuron. We find that the STRF has a rich dynamical structure, including excitatory regions positioned in general accord with the prediction of the classical tuning curve. However, whereas the STRF successfully predicts the responses to some of the natural stimuli, it surprisingly fails completely to predict the responses to others; on average, only 11\% of the response power could be predicted by the STRF. Therefore, most of the response of the neuron cannot be predicted by the linear component, although the response is deterministically related to the stimulus. Analysis of the systematic errors of the STRF model shows that this failure cannot be attributed to simple nonlinearities such as adaptation to mean intensity, rectification, or saturation. Rather, the highly nonlinear response properties of auditory cortical neurons must be attributable to nonlinear interactions between sound frequencies and time-varying properties of the neural encoder.},

	Abstract = {Songbirds such as the white-crowned sparrow memorize the song of conspecific adults during a critical period early in life and later in life develop song by utilizing auditory feedback. Neurons in one of the telencephalic nuclei controlling song have recently been shown to respond to acoustic stimuli. I investigated the auditory response properties of units in this nucleus using a technique that permitted great flexibility in manipulating complex stimuli such as song. A few of the units exhibited considerable selectivity for the individual's own song. In wild-caught birds, song-specific units exhibited intradialect selectivity. In those birds that sang abnormal songs due to laboratory manipulation of song exposure during the critical period for song learning, units were selective for the abnormal songs. By systematic modification of a song, and by construction of complex synthetic sounds mimicking song, the acoustic parameters responsible for the response selectivity were identified. Song-specific units responded to sequences of two song parts but not to the parts in isolation. Modification of the frequencies of either part of the sequence, or increasing the interval between the parts, varied the strength of the response. Thus, temporal as well as spectral parameters were important for the response. When sequences of synthetic sounds mimicking song were effective in evoking an excitatory response, the response was sensitive to the aforementioned manipulations. Wih these techniques it was possible to elucidate the acoustic parameters required to excite song-specific units. All songs of the repertoire eliciting a strong excitatory response contained the appropriate parameters, which were missing from all weakly effective, ineffective, or inhibitory songs. },

	Abstract = {1. A detailed theory of cerebellar cortex is proposed whose consequence is that the cerebellum learns to perform motor skills. Two forms of input‚{\"A}{\^\i}output relation are described, both consistent with the cortical theory. One is suitable for learning movements (actions), and the other for learning to maintain posture and balance (maintenance reflexes).2. It is known that the cells of the inferior olive and the cerebellar Purkinje cells have a special one-to-one relationship induced by the climbing fibre input. For learning actions, it is assumed that:(a) each olivary cell responds to a cerebral instruction for an elemental movement. Any action has a defining representation in terms of elemental movements, and this representation has a neural expression as a sequence of firing patterns in the inferior olive; and(b) in the correct state of the nervous system, a Purkinje cell can initiate the elemental movement to which its corresponding olivary cell responds.3. Whenever an olivary cell fires, it sends an impulse (via the climbing fibre input) to its corresponding Purkinje cell. This Purkinje cell is also exposed (via the mossy fibre input) to information about the context in which its olivary cell fired; and it is shown how, during rehearsal of an action, each Purkinje cell can learn to recognize such contexts. Later, when the action has been learnt, occurrence of the context alone is enough to fire the Purkinje cell, which then causes the next elemental movement. The action thus progresses as it did during rehearsal.4. It is shown that an interpretation of cerebellar cortex as a structure which allows each Purkinje cell to learn a number of contexts is consistent both with the distributions of the various types of cell, and with their known excitatory or inhibitory natures. It is demonstrated that the mossy fibre-granule cell arrangement provides the required pattern discrimination capability.5. The following predictions are made.(a) The synapses from parallel fibres to Purkinje cells are facilitated by the conjunction of presynaptic and climbing fibre (or post-synaptic) activity.(b) No other cerebellar synapses are modifiable.(c) Golgi cells are driven by the greater of the inputs from their upper and lower dendritic fields.6. For learning maintenance reflexes, 2(a) and 2(b) are replaced by2‚{\"A}≤. Each olivary cell is stimulated by one or more receptors, all of whose activities are usually reduced by the results of stimulating the corresponding Purkinje cell.7. It is shown that if (2‚{\"A}≤) is satisfied, the circuit receptor ‚{\"U}{\'\i} olivary cell ‚{\"U}{\'\i} Purkinje cell ‚{\"U}{\'\i} effector may be regarded as a stabilizing reflex circuit which is activated by learned mossy fibre inputs. This type of reflex has been called a learned conditional reflex, and it is shown how such reflexes can solve problems of maintaining posture and balance.8. 5(a), and either (2) or (2‚{\"A}≤) are essential to the theory: 5(b) and 5(c) are not absolutely essential, and parts of the theory could survive the disproof of either.},

	Abstract = {
Here, we examine the connectivity of two previously identified telencephalic stations of the auditory system of adult zebra finches, the neostriatal shelf that underlies the high vocal center (HVC) and the archistriatal cup adjacent to the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA). We used different kinds of neuroanatomical tracers to visualize the projections from the shelf to the HVC. In addition, we show that the shelf projects to the cup and that the cup projects to thalamic, midbrain, and pontine nuclei of the ascending auditory pathway. Our observations extend to songbirds anatomical features that are found in the auditory pathways of a nonoscine bird, the pigeon (Wild et al. [1993] J. Comp. Neurol. 337:32-62), and we suggest that the descending auditory projections found in mammals may also be a general property of the avian brain. Finally, we show that the oscine song control system is closely apposed to auditory pathways at many levels. Our observations may help in understanding the evolution and organization of networks for vocal communication and vocal learning in songbirds.},

	Abstract = {In a neurophysiological study within the auditory centers of the mediocaudal telencephalon of the starling, 601 neurons were tested for auditory responses. 369 of these units responded to pure tones, noise bands, amplitude modulations (AM), or species-specific sounds. Of all the auditory neurons, 16.8\% did not respond to pure tones but only to more complex stimuli (tone-unresponsive-, TU-units). The remaining auditory units were classified as tone-responsive (TR-units). In 44.3\% of TR-units (i.e. 36.9\% of all auditory units) differing responses to tones versus more complex stimuli were observed. Responses as they occur in TU-units and in the differing responses of TR-units can be explained by neuronal extraction of features in the time (108 out of 198 neurons) and in the spectral domain (82 out of 198 neurons). Responses to species-specific sounds usually can be explained in terms of extraction of these features. Among neurons sensitive to temporal features, exclusive responses to a narrow range of AM frequencies were observed. In those TU-units that represent spectral features some restrict their responses to noise bands with distinct bandwidths centered around a specific midfrequency. These units reject both wider and narrower noise bands. A tonotopic arrangement of auditory units is found in field L, the surrounding neostriatum (NCM), and the Hyperstriatum ventrale (HV). Isofrequency lines run as a continuum through NCM, field L, and the caudal part of HV. TU-units are integrated into the tonotopic gradient according to the midfrequency of effective stimuli (e.g. noise bands or AM). The anatomical position of auditory units is correlated to their response properties. Within one isofrequency contour an increase in response selectivity is seen from field L to the postsynaptic areas in the NCM and the HV. The results are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms of feature extraction in the avian auditory system.},

	Abstract = {Humans and animals must often discriminate between complex natural sounds in the presence of competing sounds (maskers). Although the auditory cortex is thought to be important in this task, the impact of maskers on cortical discrimination remains poorly understood. We examined neural responses in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) field L (homologous to primary auditory cortex) to target birdsongs that were embedded in three different maskers (broadband noise, modulated noise and birdsong chorus). We found two distinct forms of interference in the neural responses: the addition of spurious spikes occurring primarily during the silent gaps between song syllables and the suppression of informative spikes occurring primarily during the syllables. Both effects systematically degraded neural discrimination as the target intensity decreased relative to that of the masker. The behavioral performance of songbirds degraded in a parallel manner. Our results identify neural interference that could explain the perceptual interference at the heart of the cocktail party problem.},

	Abstract = {Our knowledge of the sensory world is encoded by neurons in
sequences of discrete, identical pulses termed action potentials or
spikes. There is persistent controversy about the extent to which the
precise timing of these spikes is relevant to the function of the
brain. We revisit this issue, using the motion
sensitive neurons of the fly visual system as a test case. New
experimental methods allow us to deliver more nearly natural visual
stimuli, comparable to those which flies encounter in free, acrobatic
flight, and new mathematical methods allow us to draw more reliable
conclusions about the information content of neural responses even
when the set of possible responses is very large. We find that
significant amounts of visual information are represented by details
of the spike train at millisecond and sub-millisecond precision, even
though the sensory input has a correlation time of ~60 ms; different
patterns of spike timing represent distinct motion trajectories, and
the absolute timing of spikes points to particular features of these
trajectories with high precision. Under these naturalistic conditions,
the system's information transmission rate still increases with higher
photon flux, even though individual photoreceptors are counting more
than one million photons per second. Further, exploiting the
relatively slow dynamics of the stimulus, the system removes
redundancy and so generates a more efficient neural code.

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.

Previous work indicates that a robust approach to this problem is the maximization of the benefit function known as "modularity" over possible divisions of a network. Here we show that this maximization process can be written in terms of the eigenspectrum of a matrix we call the modularity matrix, which plays a role in community detection similar to that played by the graph Laplacian in graph partitioning calculations. This result leads us to a number of possible algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as several other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure in networks and a new centrality measure that identifies those vertices that occupy central positions within the communities to which they belong. The algorithms and measures proposed are illustrated with applications to a variety of real-world complex networks.},

	Abstract = {Source separation arises in a variety of signal processing applications, ranging from speech processing to medical image analysis. The separation of a superposition of multiple signals is accomplished by taking into account the structure of the mixing process and by making assumptions about the sources. When the information about the mixing process and sources is limited, the problem is called ?blind?. By assuming that the sources can be represented sparsely in a given basis, recent research has demonstrated that solutions to previously problematic blind source separation problems can be obtained. In some cases, solutions are possible to problems intractable by previous non-sparse methods. Indeed, sparse methods provide a powerful approach to the separation of linear mixtures of independent data. This paper surveys the recent arrival of sparse blind source separation methods and the previously existing non-sparse methods, providing insights and appropriate hooks into the literature along the way.},

	Abstract = {Natural images contain characteristic statistical regularities that set them apart from purely random images. Understanding what these regularities are can enable natural images to be coded more efficiently. In this paper, we describe some of the forms of structure that are contained in natural images, and we show how these are related to the response properties of neurons at early stages of the visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i.e. more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for finding efficient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an efficient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields similar to those in the mammalian striate cortex.},

This strategy, referred to as ‚{\"A}{\`o}sparse coding‚{\"A}{\^o}, could possibly confer several advantages. First, it allows for increased storage capacity in associative memories; second, it makes the structure in natural signals explicit; third, it represents complex data in a way that is easier to read out at subsequent levels of processing; and fourth, it saves energy. Recent physiological recordings from sensory neurons have indicated that sparse coding could be a ubiquitous strategy employed in several different modalities across different organisms.},

	Abstract = {This letter presents a general framework based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) to mathematically describe and manipulate spike trains. The main idea is the definition of inner products to allow spike train signal processing from basic principles while incorporating their statistical description as point processes. Moreover, because many inner products can be formulated, a particular definition can be crafted to best fit an application. These ideas are illustrated by the definition of a number of spike train inner products. To further elicit the advantages of the RKHS framework, a family of these inner products, the cross-intensity (CI) kernels, is analyzed in detail. This inner product family encapsulates the statistical description from the conditional intensity functions of spike trains. The problem of their estimation is also addressed. The simplest of the spike train kernels in this family provide an interesting perspective to others' work, as will be demonstrated in terms of spike train distance measures. Finally, as an application example, the RKHS framework is used to derive a clustering algorithm for spike trains from simple principles.},

We analyze the estimation of one such model for which this nonlinear step is implemented by a known parametric function; the assumption that this function is known speeds the estimation process considerably. We investigate the shape of the likelihood function for this type of model, give a simple condition on the nonlinearity ensuring that no non-global local maxima exist in the likelihood-leading, in turn, to efficient algorithms for the computation of the maximum likelihood estimator-and discuss the implications for the form of the allowed nonlinearities. Finally, we note some interesting connections between the likelihood-based estimators and the classical spike-triggered average estimator, discuss some useful extensions of the basic model structure, and provide two novel applications to physiological data.},

	Abstract = {Several animals mitigate the fundamental conflict between sleep and wakefulness by engaging in unihemispheric sleep, a unique state during which one cerebral hemisphere sleeps while the other remains awake. Among mammals, unihemispheric sleep is restricted to aquatic species (Cetaceans, eared seals and manatees). In contrast to mammals, unihemispheric sleep is widespread in birds, and may even occur in reptiles. Unihemispheric sleep allows surfacing to breathe in aquatic mammals and predator detection in birds. Despite the apparent utility in being able to sleep unihemispherically, very few mammals sleep in this manner. This is particularly interesting since the reptilian ancestors to mammals may have slept unihemispherically. The relative absence of unihemispheric sleep in mammals suggests that a trade off exists between unihemispheric sleep and other adaptive brain functions occurring during sleep or wakefulness. Presumably, the benefits of sleeping unihemispherically only outweigh the costs under extreme circumstances such as sleeping at sea. Ultimately, a greater understanding of the reasons for little unihemispheric sleep in mammals promises to provide insight into the functions of sleep, in general.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative comparative studies of sleep have focused exclusively on mammals. Such studies have repeatedly found strong relationships between the time spent in various sleep states and constitutive variables related to morphology, physiology, and life history. These studies influenced the development of several prominent hypotheses for the functions of sleep, but the applicability of these patterns and hypotheses to non-mammalian taxa is unclear. Here, we present the first quantitative analysis of sleep in a non-mammalian taxon (birds), focusing on the daily amount of time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep as determined by electrophysiological methods. We examined the relationships between constitutive and sleep variables in 23 avian species following earlier studies in mammals, but also considered an index of exposure to predators while asleep and controlled for shared evolutionary history among taxa. Overall, our results were very different from those obtained for mammals. Most remarkably, the relationships between both SWS time and REM sleep time and all constitutive variables were very weak and markedly non-significant, even though we had adequate power to detect correlations typical of the mammalian data. Only an index of exposure to predation during sleep was significantly related to sleep time, which is the only result common to both birds and mammals. Our results suggest that further insight into the function(s) of sleep across the animal kingdom may require an expansion of sleep research beyond the current mammalian paradigm.},

	Abstract = {Memory is believed to depend on activity-dependent changes in the strength of synapses1. In part, this view is based on evidence that the efficacy of synapses can be enhanced or depressed depending on the timing of pre- and postsynaptic activity2, 3, 4, 5. However, when such plastic synapses are incorporated into neural network models, stability problems may develop because the potentiation or depression of synapses increases the likelihood that they will be further strengthened or weakened6. Here we report biological evidence for a homeostatic mechanism that reconciles the apparently opposite requirements of plasticity and stability. We show that, in intercalated neurons of the amygdala, activity-dependent potentiation or depression of particular glutamatergic inputs leads to opposite changes in the strength of inputs ending at other dendritic sites. As a result, little change in total synaptic weight occurs, even though the relative strength of inputs is modified. Furthermore, hetero- but not homosynaptic alterations are blocked by intracellular dialysis of drugs that prevent Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Thus, in intercalated neurons at least, inverse heterosynaptic plasticity tends to compensate for homosynaptic long-term potentiation and depression, thus stabilizing total synaptic weight.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the properties of a metric between two distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), for content-based image retrieval. The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.},

	Abstract = {
Climbing fiber (CF) activation evokes a large all-or-nothing electrical response in Purkinje cells (PCs), the complex spike. It has been suggested that the role of CFs (and thus complex spikes) is that of a ‚{\"A}{\'u}teacher‚{\"A}{\`u} in simple learning paradigms such as associative eyeblink conditioning. An alternative hypothesis describes the olivocerebellar system as part of a timing device and denies a role of the CF input in learning. To date, neither of these hypotheses nor others can definitively be verified or discounted. Similarly, the complex spike evades a clear understanding when it comes to the cellular events underlying complex spike generation. What is known, however, is that complex spikes are associated with large dendritic calcium signals that are required for the induction of long-term depression (LTD) at the parallel fiber (PF)-PC synapse. PF-LTD is a form of long-term synaptic plasticity that has been suggested to underlie certain forms of cerebellar motor learning. In contrast to the PF input, the CF input has been considered invariant. Our recent discovery of LTD at the CF input shows that complex spikes are less static than previously assumed. In addition to depression of CF-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents, long-lasting, selective reduction of slow complex spike components could be observed after brief CF tetanization. To understand the functional implications of CF-LTD, it is crucial to know the types of currents constituting the specific complex spike components. Here we review the ‚{\"A}{\'u}anatomy‚{\"A}{\`u} of the complex spike as well as our observations of activity-dependent complex spike waveform modifications. In addition, we discuss which properties CF-LTD might add to the circuitry of the cerebellar cortex.

	Abstract = {Although understanding the processing of natural sounds is
an important goal in auditory neuroscience, relatively little is known
about the neural coding of these sounds. Recently we demonstrated that
the spectral temporal receptive field (STRF), a description of the
stimulus-response function of auditory neurons, could be derived from
responses to arbitrary ensembles of complex sounds including
vocalizations. In this study, we use this method to investigate the
auditory processing of natural sounds in the birdsong system. We
obtain neural responses from several regions of the songbird auditory
forebrain to a large ensemble of bird songs and use these data to
calculate the STRFs, which are the best linear model of the
spectral-temporal features of sound to which auditory neurons
respond. We find that these neurons respond to a wide variety of
features in songs ranging from simple tonal components to more complex
spectral-temporal structures such as frequency sweeps and multi-peaked
frequency stacks. We quantify spectral and temporal characteristics of
these features by extracting several parameters from the
STRFs. Moreover, we assess the linearity versus nonlinearity of
encoding by quantifying the quality of the predictions of the neural
responses to songs obtained using the STRFs. Our results reveal
successively complex functional stages of song analysis by neurons in
the auditory forebrain. When we map the properties of auditory
forebrain neurons, as characterized by the STRF parameters, onto
conventional anatomical subdivisions of the auditory forebrain, we
find that although some properties are shared across different
subregions, the distribution of several parameters is suggestive of
hierarchical processing.},

In this article, we study convex problems in quadratic programming where the optimization is confined to an axis-aligned region in the nonnegative orthant. For these problems, we derive multiplicative updates that improve the value of the objective function at each iteration and converge monotonically to the global minimum. The updates have a simple closed form and do not involve any heuristics or free parameters that must be tuned to ensure convergence. Despite their simplicity, they differ strikingly in form from other multiplicative updates used in machine learning. We provide complete proofs of convergence for these updates and describe their application to problems in signal processing and pattern recognition.

	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Neurons, or nerve cells in the brain, communicate with each other using stereotyped electric pulses, called spikes. It is believed that neurons convey information mainly through the frequency of the transmitted spikes, called the firing rate. In addition, neurons may communicate some information through the finer temporal patterns of the spikes. Neuronal firing patterns may depend on cellular organization, which varies among the regions of the brain, according to the roles they play, such as sensation, association, and motion. In order to examine the relationship among signals, structure, and function, we devised a metric to detect firing irregularity intrinsic and specific to individual neurons and analyzed spike sequences from over 1,000 neurons in 15 different cortical areas. Here we report two results of this study. First, we found that neurons exhibit stable firing patterns that can be characterized as -Y¥regular$\,^{\circ}$, ¥random$\,^{\circ}$, and ¥bursty$\,^{\circ}$. Second, we observed a strong correlation between the type of signaling pattern exhibited by neurons in a given area and the function of that area. This suggests that, in addition to reflecting the cellular organization of the brain, neuronal signaling patterns may also play a role in specific types of neuronal computations.</p>},

	Abstract = {
Most synaptic inputs are made onto the dendritic tree. Recent work has shown that dendrites play an active role in transforming synaptic input into neuronal output and in defining the relationships between active synapses. In this review, we discuss how these dendritic properties influence the rules governing the induction of synaptic plasticity. We argue that the location of synapses in the dendritic tree, and the type of dendritic excitability associated with each synapse, play decisive roles in determining the plastic properties of that synapse. Furthermore, since the electrical properties of the dendritic tree are not static, but can be altered by neuromodulators and by synaptic activity itself, we discuss how learning rules may be dynamically shaped by tuning dendritic function. We conclude by describing how this reciprocal relationship between plasticity of dendritic excitability and synaptic plasticity has changed our view of information processing and memory storage in neuronal networks.

	Abstract = {A modified Newton method for unconstrained minimization is presented and analyzed. The modification is based upon the model trust region approach. This report contains a thorough analysis of the locally constrained quadratic minimizations that arise as subproblems in the modified Newton iteration. Several promising alternatives are presented for solving these subproblems in ways that overcome certain theoretical difficulties exposed by this analysis. Very strong convergence results are presented concerning the minimization algorithm. In particular, the explicit use of second order information is justified by demonstrating that the iterates converge to a point which satisfies the second order necessary conditions for minimization. With the exception of very pathological cases this occurs whenever the algorithm is applied to problems with continuous second partial derivatives.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews a novel hypothesis about the functions of
slow wave sleep: the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis. According to the
hypothesis, plastic processes occurring during wakefulness result in a
net increase in synaptic strength in many brain circuits. The role of
sleep is to downscale synaptic strength to a baseline level that is
energetically sustainable, makes efficient use of gray matter space,
and is beneficial for learning and memory. Thus, sleep is the price we
have to pay for plasticity, and its goal is the homeostatic regulation
of the total synaptic weight impinging on neurons. The hypothesis
accounts for a large number of experimental facts, makes several
specific predictions, and has implications for both sleep and mood
disorders.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in sensory systems convey information about physical stimuli in their spike trains. In vitro, single neurons respond precisely and reliably to the repeated injection of the same fluctuating current, producing regions of elevated firing rate, termed events. Analysis of these spike trains reveals that multiple distinct spike patterns can be identified as trial-to-trial correlations between spike times (Fellous, Tiesinga, Thomas, & Sejnowski, 2004). Finding events in data with realistic spiking statistics is challenging because events belonging to different spike patterns may overlap. We propose a method for finding spiking events that uses contextual information to disambiguate which pattern a trial belongs to. The procedure can be applied to spike trains of the same neuron across multiple trials to detect and separate responses obtained during different brain states. The procedure can also be applied to spike trains from multiple simultaneously recorded neurons in order to identify volleys of near-synchronous activity or to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The procedure was tested using artificial data as well as recordings in vitro in response to fluctuating current waveforms.},

Theoretical analysis combined with patch clamp recordings from pairs of neocortical pyramidal neurons revealed that the rate of synaptic depression, which depends on the probability of neurotransmitter release, dictates the extent to which firing rate and temporal coherence of action potentials within a presynaptic population are signaled to the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic response primarily reflects rates of firing when depression is slow and temporal coherence when depression is fast. A wide range of rates of synaptic depression between different pairs of pyramidal neurons was found, suggesting that the relative contribution of rate and temporal signals varies along a continuum. We conclude that by setting the rate of synaptic depression, release probability is an important factor in determining the neural code.},

	Abstract = {Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has previously been shown to be a useful decomposition for multivariate data. In this paper, we introduce this new technique to the field of fMRI data analysis. In order to make the representation suitable for task-related brain activation detection, we imposed some additional constraints, and defined an improved contrast function. We deduced the update rules and proved the convergence of the algorithm. In the procedure, the number of factors was determined by visual assessment. We studied 8 healthy right-handed adult volunteers by a 3.0T GE Signa scanner. A block design motor paradigm (bilateral finger tapping) stimulated the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response. Gradient Echo EPI sequence was utilized to acquire BOLD contrast functional images. With this constrained NMF (cNMF) we could obtain major activation components and the corresponding time courses, which showed high correlation with the reference function (r>0.7). The results showed that our method would be feasible for detection brain activations from task-related fMRI series.

	Abstract = {A central finding in many cortical areas is that single
neurons can match behavioral performance in the discrimination of
sensory stimuli. However, whether this is true for natural behaviors
involving complex natural stimuli remains unknown. Here we use the
model system of songbirds to address this problem.  Specifically, we
investigate whether neurons in field L, the homolog of primary
auditory cortex, can match behavioral performance in the
discrimination of conspecific songs. We use a classification framework
based on the (dis)similarity between single spike trains to quantify
neural discrimination. We use this framework to investigate the
discriminability of single spike trains in field L in response to
conspecific songs, testing different candidate neural codes underlying
discrimination. We find that performance based on spike timing is
significantly higher than performance based on spike rate and
interspike intervals. We then assess the impact of temporal
correlations in spike trains on discrimination. In contrast to widely
discussed effects of correlations in limiting the accuracy of a
population code, temporal correlations appear to improve the
performance of single neurons in the majority of cases. Finally, we
compare neural performance with behavioral performance. We find a
diverse range of performance levels in field L, with neural
performance matching behavioral accuracy only for the best neurons
using a spike-timing-based code.},

	Abstract = {Invariant features of temporally varying signals are
                 useful for analysis and classification. Slow feature
                 analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant
                 or slowly varying features from a vectorial input
                 signal. SFA is based on a non-linear expansion of the
                 input signal and application of principal component
                 analysis to this expanded signal and its time
                 derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal
                 solution within a family of functions directly and can
                 learn to extract a large number of decorrelated
                 features, which are ordered by their degree of
                 invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to
                 process high dimensional input signals and to extract
                 complex features. Slow feature analysis is applied
                 first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple
                 cell output including disparity and motion. Then, more
                 complicated input-output functions are learned by
                 repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical
                 network of SFA-modules is presented as a simple model
                 of the visual system. The same unstructured network can
                 learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a
                 lesser degree, illumination invariance for
                 one-dimensional objects, depending only on the training
                 stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects
                 sufficed to achieve good generalization to new objects.
                 The generated representation is suitable for object
                 recognition. Performance degrades, if the network is
                 trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously.},

@article{WohlgemuthRonacher2006a,
	Abstract = {Sound envelope cues play a crucial role for the recognition and discrimination of communication signals in diverse taxa, such as vertebrates and arthropods. Using a classification based on metric similarities of spike trains we investigate how well amplitude modulations (AMs) of sound signals can be distinguished at three levels of the locust's auditory pathway: receptors and local and ascending neurons. The spike train metric has the advantage of providing information about the necessary evaluation time window and about the optimal temporal resolution of processing, thereby yielding clues to possible coding principles. It further allows one to disentangle the respective contributions of spike count and spike timing to the fidelity of discrimination. These results are compared with the traditional paradigm using modulation transfer functions. Spike trains of receptors and two primary-like local interneurons enable an excellent discrimination of different AM frequencies, up to about 150 Hz. In these neurons discriminability depends almost completely on the timing of spikes, which must be evaluated with a temporal resolution of <5 ms. Even short spike-train segments of 150 ms, equivalent to five to eight spikes, suffice for a high (70\%) discrimination performance. For the third level of processing, the ascending interneurons, the overall discrimination accuracy is reduced. Spike count differences become more important for the discrimination whereas the exact timing of spikes contributes less. This shift in temporal resolution does not primarily depend on the investigated stimulus space. Rather it appears to reflect a transformation of how amplitude modulations are represented at more central stages of processing.},

	Abstract = {In nature, animals encounter high dimensional sensory
stimuli that have complex statistical and dynamical
structure. Attempts to study the neural coding of these natural
signals face challenges both in the selection of the signal ensemble
and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For zebra
finches, naturalistic stimuli can be defined as sounds that they
encounter in a colony of conspecific birds. We assembled an ensemble
of these sounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra finches, and then
analyzed the response of single neurons in the songbird central
auditory area (field L) to continuous playback of long segments from
this ensemble.  Following methods developed in the fly visual system,
we measured the information that spike trains provide about the
acoustic stimulus without any assumptions about which features of the
stimulus are relevant. Preliminary results indicate that large amounts
of information are carried by spike timing, with roughly half of the
information accessible only at time resolutions better than 10 ms;
additional information is still being revealed as time resolution is
improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by
the locking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of
spike rate) vs. that carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial
results show that in field L, temporal patterns give at least ~20\%
extra information. Thus, single central auditory neurons can provide
an informative representation of naturalistic sounds, in which spike
timing may play a significant role.},

	Abstract = {We address the question of finding the community structure of a complex network. In an earlier effort [H. Zhou, Phys. Rev. E 67, 041908 (2003)], the concept of network random walking is introduced and a distance measure defined. Here we calculate, based on this distance measure, the dissimilarity index between nearest-neighboring vertices of a network and design an algorithm to partition these vertices into communities that are hierarchically organized. Each community is characterized by an upper and a lower dissimilarity threshold. The algorithm is applied to several artificial and real-world networks, and excellent results are obtained. In the case of artificially generated random modular networks, this method outperforms the algorithm based on the concept of edge betweenness centrality. For yeast‚{\"A}{\^o}s protein-protein interaction network, we are able to identify many clusters that have well defined biological functions.},
