Sparse coding has been observed in neurons in the visual tract \cite{OlshausenField2004}, a simple model is proposed for such neurons.

It is unlikely that a neuron is ever truly ``off’’, so it is assumed that a neuron has a base-firing state that will be referred to as the ``off-state’’.  For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that a neuron in such an ``off-state’’ would have a constant firing rate, $\lambda_d$.  Correspondingly, for sparse-coding a neuron must have a higher firing-rate when the feature that it codes for is present; this firing rate, $\lambda_u$, is also taken to be constant.

The model also assumes that the
